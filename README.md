## Abstract

This data science competition submission examines the performance of adolescents in predicting risk and understanding future consequences, based on data from the Yale School of Medicine's Play2Prevent Lab Educational Videogame "Elm City Stories". The analysis aims to provide researchers from the Play2Prevent lab at the Yale School of Medicine with actionable insights for drawing connections between real-life behavior and in-game performance behavior. Using a comprehensive dataset, the study evaluates trends in player ages, in-game skills, stacks, and interactions. Based on EDA work, players belonging to the age 11 cohort severely underperformed compared to ages 12-14, thereby failing to meet the goals by Play2Prevent to teach adolescents about risk assessment. These insights are intended to provide feedback for the Yale School of Medicine in improving certain aspects of their game design to increase retention among younger players, with future plans involving machine learning for detecting interactions among key variables. The study underscores the importance of leveraging educational videogame data to understand how different players behave and how to encourage certain desirable actions.

## Data Acknowledgment

The data used in this project was provided by the Yale School of Medicine at ASA Datafest 2022 under strict privacy and security regulations. Due to privacy policies, the raw data cannot be shared.

## Conclusion

### Insights

### Limitations

- **Data Accessibility**: Due to privacy regulations set by ASA Datafest, raw data could not be exported.

- **Time Constraints**: Due to the time constraints set by the event, with the whole event taking 48 hours in duration, we were not able to fully investigate the project as extensibly as we believe we would be able to.

- **Modeling**: Although EDA helps to lay the foundation for the ideas we hope to address, modeling would help support these claims further; our mistake for doing modeling work limits the validity of our findings.
