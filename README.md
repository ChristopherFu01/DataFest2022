## Conclusion

### Insights

### Limitations

- **Data Accessibility**: Due to privacy regulations set by ASA Datafest, raw data could not be exported.

- **Time Constraints**: Due to the time constraints set by the event, with the whole event taking 48 hours in duration, we were not able to fully investigate the project as extensibly as we believe we would be able to.

- **Modeling**: Although EDA helps to lay the foundation for the ideas we hope to address, modeling would help support these claims further; our mistake for doing modeling work limits the validity of our findings.
